        Introductory Questions
    </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>I'm Jared, and I'm a junior studying Communication Design and Art History.</li>
        <li>I've taken some basic coding classes before, but now I'm more interested in relearning and being able to apply them to my specific craft as a designer and just building up my skillset.</li>
        <li>I took one basic coding class in high school, and otherwise I've used HTML/CSS site builders like Wordpress a lot for my work.</li>
        <li>I hope to learn how to go about visualizing a new website through coding itself, since I feel like it's been hard to connect the actual code with the visuals in my experience.</li>
        <li>One thing that I think will be very different is making sure a page can adapt to different screen sizes, as opposed to a single size for print media.</li>
        <li>I think the <a href=" https://www.zara.com/us/"> Zara website</a> is very effective in its design, since it feels very simplistic to help make their wide range of products feel clean and easy to navigate.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org">AIGA Eye on Design website</a> is really good at communicating the different section headings, and having clear thumbnails to illustrate what each article is about.</li>
        <li>I've always really enjoyed the <a href="https://oa.letterformarchive.org">Letterform Archive site</a> since it has a really good sense of hierarchy, and the different categories of media, time period, and others are very clearly delineated and customizable.</li>

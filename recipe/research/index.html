        <h3>Dubai chocolate is a milk chocolate bar filled with a sweet pistachio-tahini cream and kadayif (chopped filo pastry).The consistency of the filling ranges from finely ground to a paste. The creamy textures of the pistachio and tahini contrasts with the crunch of the kadayif.</h3>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Milk chocolate</li>
        <li>White cocolate chips</li>
        <li>Kataifi pastry dough</li>
        <li>Pistachio butter</li>
        <li>Tahini (sesame paste)</li>
        <li>Chocolate bar molds</li>
        <li>Food coloring (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Toast the kataifi. Toast coarsely chopped kataifi pastry dough in butter on the stovetop until golden-brown and crispy, then transfer to a bowl. Stir in creamy pistachio butter, tahini, and salt.</li>
        <li>Melt the white chocolate. Fill a saucepan halfway with water and bring to a simmer. Set a heatproof bowl over the simmering water to create a double boiler and add the white chocolate chips. Cook, stirring constantly, until completely melted. Carefully remove the bowl from the double boiler. Stir in green food coloring, then drizzle over the bottom of a chocolate mold to create an irregular pattern. Refrigerate the molds while you melt the milk chocolate.</li>
        <li>Melt the milk chocolate. Set the same bowl back over the water. Add milk chocolate chips and butter to the bowl. Heat, stirring constantly, until completely melted. Spread just enough of the melted chocolate to coat the bottom and sides of the mold in a thin, even layer. Freeze until set.</li>
        <li>Fill the chocolate bars. Add the pistachio cream mixture to the chocolate mold and use an offset spatula or the back of a spoon to gently spread and press the filling into an even layer. Pour the remaining melted chocolate over the top and spread into an even layer to fill the mold. Using a bench scraper or offset spatula, lightly scrape over the top to level and remove excess chocolate.</li>
        <li>Finish the chocolate bars. Refrigerate until completely set. Remove the bar from the mold and trim off any overhanging chocolate with a knife if desired.</li>
        </ol>

            <h2>Recipe websites</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.epicurious.com">epicurious:</a> I really liked this website's layout, since everything is super big and uses a consistent style of photography to showcase each recipe. It also uses a very neutral color scheme, with the exception of the bright red to highlight key information across the site.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.delish.com">delish:</a> Delish is a website that I've actually used before, so my familiarity with it might be partially why I think it's a good example. I really enjoy the use of black and white for the interface which allows the food photography to really shine in contrast. I also think the recipe pages are super well formatted, like having an editable list of ingredients off to the side to make it easier to keep track of.</li>
                <li><a href="https://damndelicious.net">Damn Delicious:</a> This website is super clean and feels very easy to navigate. One aspect I really love is the categories of recipes it lists, which feel more casual and catered to an average person looking for something to cook within a certain price range or level of difficulty.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Non-recipe websites</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.zillow.com">Zillow:</a> Zillow's site is one that I've always thought was very well done, especially with how clean it feels despite the amount of information it holds. I think the tags underneath each listing describing key information is super helpful and fits in with the rest of the design language being utilized.</li>
                <li><a href="https://spotify.design">Spotify Design:</a> Despite not being the biggest fan of the Spotify website interface, I think Spotify Design does an amazing job of feeling approachable and usable while also featuring super creative and interactive components that sets it apart from other sites I've seen. I especially love the graphic animations that trigger when you hover over certain images or articles, it has a more abstract feeling of music without being super obvious about it.</li>
                <li><a href="https://pitchfork.com">Pitchfork:</a> This website feels similar to Spotify Design, but has its own featurs that also help it stand on its own. One thing I really like is the consistent size of header images, and the use of animations to make each piece look cohesive with one another on the main homepage. I also think the chosen typefaces are very readable, and the different sections of the site are clearly delineated.</li>
